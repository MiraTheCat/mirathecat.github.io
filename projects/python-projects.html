                        A game made for a school project in tenth grade (Yes this was in the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, how did you know?)
                        <br> It has 4 levels, where you have to get to the exit without being killed by the viruses.
                        <br> To defend yourself, you have to collect antibac from antibac dispensers, which are located at different areas in every level.
                        The antibac can then be dropped on the floor by clicking "A".
                        You start with 1 antibac and get 5 more for every dispenser collected.
                        <br> To move, use the arrow keys, and click "N" to restart the level.
                        <br><br> This also requires the Pygame library btw
